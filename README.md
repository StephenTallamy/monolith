# Monolith Generator

Project to help automate the generation of virutal instruments based on the
"monolith" concept by Christian Henson.

Currently includes a Creator Tools project for generation of Kontakt template instruments.

The current approach is based on a "Heatmap" monolith. 

To use this code, run the heatmap.lua with appropriate file settings.

The generated Kontakt files are compatible with Dave Hilowitz's piano template scripts:

Apply the two KSP files, adjust the variables for the various groups in the 
"Voice Triggering" script and make sure you use the Resources/ directory contents.
